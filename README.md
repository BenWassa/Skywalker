# The Skywalker Quest Map

A comprehensive, interactive guide for personal and philosophical growth, inspired by the mythic journey of Luke Skywalker. This project is a companion to the "Skywalker Quest Map" podcast, designed to transform passive listening into active reflection and self-discovery.

## Features

- **Fully Styled HTML & CSS**: Modern, visually engaging design with advanced gradients, card spotlights, and responsive layout.
- **ReactBits StarBorder Effect**: Professor's Voice sections now use the exact ReactBits.dev animated border effect, with dynamic color and speed, matching the working test implementation.
- **Comprehensive Content**: All five quest stages are included, each with:
  - Podcast synopsis
  - Key scenes, character shifts, and symbolic imagery
  - Mythic & psychological foundations (with "Professor's Voice" commentary)
  - Clearly formatted "Key Concepts Explored" sections
  - Unabridged, tiered reflection questions (Padawan, Knight, Master) in individual spotlight cards
  - Stage briefings, milestones, and checkpoint debrief tables
- **Preview Row**: At the start, a preview of the tiered question cards for quick orientation.
- **Professional Formatting**: Section headers are clear and navigable (e.g., "Stage One: The Desert Longing"). All content is cleanly structured for readability and depth.
- **Appendices & Resources**: Glossary, recommended books/media, project background, and acknowledgments.

## Usage
