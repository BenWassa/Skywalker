# Testing Notes

This file tracks ideas and changes tried in the `testing` sandbox. Document what worked, what didn't and any insights for future experiments.

## 2024-06-15
- Created this log to keep track of CSS and component experiments.
- Current files: `css_test_document.html`, `css_test_styles.css`, `SpotlightCard.css`.

## 2025-06-20
- Integrated **StarBorder** component into `test_site.html` for the Professor's Voice section.
- Tweaked spotlight card hover effects with radial gradients.
- Adjusted `title-glow` and `gradient-shift` animations for smoother timing.
- Enhanced `h1` title style with a deeper 3D perspective effect.

## 2025-07-03 - Custom Audio Player Development
- **Major Achievement**: Built fully custom audio companion section
- **Files Created**: 
  - `audio-companion-section-test.html` - Complete standalone test
  - `audio-companion-section-test.css` - All custom player styles

### Custom Audio Player Features Developed:
- **Gradient Timeline**: Beautiful blue→green→purple animated progress bar
- **Smart Progress Display**: Only listened portion shows glow effects
- **Lightsaber Theme**: Star Wars-inspired design matching site aesthetic
- **Full Custom Controls**: Play/pause, timeline seeking, volume, options
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all device sizes
- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels, keyboard shortcuts (Space, M, arrows)
- **Robust Duration Detection**: Multiple fallback methods for audio metadata

### Technical Innovations:
- **Multi-layered CSS Animations**: 
  - Main gradient: 16s cycle for slow, meditative effect
  - Shimmer effect: 14s overlay animation
  - Core light: 20s inner glow transitions
  - Handle pulse: 12s golden glow animation
- **JavaScript Audio Controller**: 
  - Click/drag timeline seeking
  - Real-time progress updates
  - Volume control with hover popup
  - Keyboard shortcuts integration
- **Gradient Color Scheme**: 
  - Light blue (#87CEEB) → Steel blue (#4682B4) → Dodger blue (#1E90FF)
  - Deeper blue (#0066CC) → Light sea green (#20B2AA) → Dark turquoise (#00CED1)
  - Blue violet (#8A2BE2) → Dark orchid (#9932CC)

### Production Integration Success:
- ✅ **Main Files**: Added to `Skywalker Quest.html` + `allstyles.css`
- ✅ **Docs Files**: Added to `index.html` + `stylesheet.css`
- ✅ **Audio Sources**: Local WAV + fallback MP3 for compatibility
- ✅ **Full Functionality**: All controls working in both environments

### Key Insights:
- **Animation Timing**: Slower animations (16s+) create more meditative experience
- **Progress-Only Glow**: Only showing effects on listened portion feels intuitive
- **Color Transitions**: Blue-to-purple spectrum fits Star Wars theme perfectly
- **Custom vs Native**: Custom controls provide much better visual integration
- **Fallback Strategy**: Multiple audio sources ensure cross-browser compatibility

### Future Considerations:
- Could add waveform visualization
- Progress saving/bookmarking
- Multiple episode support
- Enhanced mobile gesture controls
- Audio transcription integration
