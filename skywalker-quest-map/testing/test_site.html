                    <p>This isn’t just about <em>Star Wars</em>. Luke’s journey is a mirror and a map for your own life. Myths aren’t just stories; they’re blueprints of the human experience. We study them not to escape reality—but to confront it more deeply, courageously, and honestly.</p>

                        <li><strong>The Podcast-First Approach:</strong> Listen to the corresponding podcast episode before each section. It provides narrative momentum and sets the emotional tone.</li>
                        <li><strong>Your Personal Journal:</strong> Use a dedicated journal or notebook. All reflection questions are meant to be answered externally.</li>
                        <li><strong>No Rush, No Right Answers:</strong> Move at your own pace. Pause, revisit, and let insights emerge over time.</li>
                        <li><strong>The Power of Symbolism:</strong> Visual motifs will act as recurring symbols throughout. These metaphors will enhance memory and deepen insight (e.g., twin suns = duality).</li>

                        <p>Having faced his shadow and inherited his legacy, Luke returns in <em>Return of the Jedi</em> as a transformed figure.
